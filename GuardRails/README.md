# GuardRails (like Qulity Control)

## Guardrails are just functions that run before and after the Agent run. The need is to validate wether the user query is according to us and whether the response of Agent is valid (or what we desired).

### If input from the user and output from the Agent is OK, everything will go as usual but if there is an issue with input or output we will stop executing agent and inform the user appropriately.
